# Architecture document for the XFSC Federated Catalogue

## XFSC Federated Catalogue

The rendered Architecture Document (PDF and full HTML rendering) is published as a **release asset** of this
repository.

### Download

Every documentation status is published as a release of this repository, tagged `cat-architecture-*`:

**[→ Architecture Document releases](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/docs/releases?q=cat-architecture&expanded=true)**

Each release carries two assets:

| Asset | Contents |
|---|---|
| `catalogue-architecture.pdf` | the complete document as PDF |
| `catalogue-architecture-html.zip` | the complete HTML rendering |

The newest release is the current documentation status; the older ones stay retrievable. Release assets
never expire, need no login, and are unaffected by the 90-day retention limit that applies to GitHub
Actions artifacts.

To read the HTML rendering, unpack the archive and open `html5/architecture/catalogue-architecture.html`
in a browser. All images and generated diagrams are contained in the archive and the main stylesheet is
embedded in the page, so the document is complete and correctly laid out without a network connection.
Three supplementary stylesheets are still loaded from CDNs (Google Fonts, Font Awesome, highlight.js);
without network access the admonition icons and the syntax colouring of code blocks are lost, nothing else.

### How the publication works

The [`Run docToolchain`](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/docs/actions/workflows/buildDocs.yml) workflow
(`.github/workflows/buildDocs.yml`) runs on every push to `main` that touches `federated-catalogue/`. It
builds the document from the AsciiDoc source in `federated-catalogue/src/docs/` via docToolchain
(`generateHTML`, `generatePDF`) and then publishes it:

1. **Package** — the PDF and a ZIP of the whole HTML output directory.
2. **Draft** — a release is created as a *draft* under a new tag
   `cat-architecture-<date>-<short commit SHA>`, for example `cat-architecture-2026-09-14-4be1769`.
3. **Attach** — both assets are uploaded while the release is still a draft.
4. **Publish** — the draft is published. Assets are attached *before* publication because GitHub's
   [immutable releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
   forbid adding, replacing or removing assets afterwards; a workflow built on overwriting would break the
   moment that setting is switched on.

Points worth knowing before changing any of this:

- **Each change gets its own release.** Existing releases are never modified. Tag names are permanently
  consumed — GitHub does not release a tag name even after the release is deleted — so the short commit SHA
  in the tag keeps every publication unique.
- **Never link `.../releases/latest`.** That URL is repository-wide: it resolves to whichever component
  published most recently, so the link would silently start pointing at another component's release. The
  workflow publishes with `make_latest=false` so the snapshot does not actively claim the marker, but GitHub
  still derives `.../releases/latest` from the newest published release when no release claims it -- the
  marker can be left unclaimed, not empty.
- **The workflow uses only the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`** (`permissions: contents: write`). No personal
  access token is involved: those are tied to an individual, expire, and would fail silently — nobody would
  notice until someone went looking for a document that had not been updated in months.
- **The workflow writes only to this repository.** There are no cross-repository writes anywhere.
- **The workflow never pushes to this repository.** It only creates a release through the API. Nothing in
  this README has to be regenerated when a release is published, which is why the link above points at the
  release listing rather than at an asset URL: an asset URL carries the release tag and would go stale.
- **The short-lived `Documentation` artifact remains** on each workflow run for quick access from the Actions
  tab. It is a convenience, not the durable copy.

Immutability protects a release against modification, not against deletion. If a guaranteed long-term
availability is required, a copy has to be kept outside GitHub as well.

## About the Catalogue

The XFSC Federated Catalogue manages metadata objects — typically verifiable credentials or RDF descriptions of
providers, service offerings, and resources — throughout their life cycle and exposes them to consumers. It verifies
these objects against schemas and trust anchors.

The current generation of the catalogue modularizes credential verification against trust anchors and generalizes
metadata-object management beyond credentials, enabling reuse as a template repository for adjacent services.

The full functional and non-functional specification is published in the same documentation repository and linked from
the rendered document above.

The reference implementation lives
at [eclipse-xfsc/federated-catalogue](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/federated-catalogue).
